# Homebrew
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Homebrew/brew.svg)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases)

Features, usage and installation instructions are [summarised on the homepage](https://brew.sh). Terminology (e.g. the difference between a Cellar, Tap, Cask and so forth) is [explained here](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#homebrew-terminology).

## What Packages Are Available?
1. Type `brew search` for a list.
2. Or visit [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh) to browse packages online.
3. Or use `brew search --desc <keyword>` to browse packages from the command line.

## More Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [our documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/).

## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting).

A good starting point for contributing is running `brew audit --strict` with some of the packages you use (e.g. `brew audit --strict wget` if you use `wget`) and then read through the warnings, try to fix them until `brew audit --strict` shows no results and [submit a pull request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request). If no formulae you use have warnings you can run `brew audit --strict` without arguments to have it run on all packages and pick one.
